# Flappy_Bird_PyTorch_Genetic_Algorithm

Flappy bird AI trained using genetic algorithm. This is pretrained, so you can run with success by running FlappyBird file. If you want for the bird to train from
scratch, you need to locate the code at the bottom of this FlappyBird python file, where when we create the gamerun() object, just set the
'basics' input to be None
